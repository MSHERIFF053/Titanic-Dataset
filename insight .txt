in real total there was 2200 passenger travelling in titanic as per web source 
but this data set is missing many crutial values we removed some records to make it easy to analyse

after removing duplicates and missing values
i made a dashboard and ploted some graphs 
analysing the dashboard we can find that there where total 1309 passengers 
and they were divided into 3 classes based on their ticket premium ( I , II , III - CLASS)
I is the more luxury class 

54% of passengers were travelling in III class ticket
21% of passengers were travelling in II class ticket
25% of passengers were travelling in I class ticket   (after removing missing columns)

all 3 class classes combined tickets worth $4350.48 

after accident 809 passenger were dead and 500 survied 

females died = 127
males died = 339 

this variation was caused because at first only children and women were sent on lifeboats.

I CLASS PASSENGERS DIED = 123
II CLASS PASSENGERS DIED = 158
III CLASS PASSENGERS DIED = 528 

THIS DIFFERENCE IS SEEN BECAUSE ELITE PASSENGER WERE GIVEN THE FIRST OPPURTUNITY TO ESCAPE
